# Hadrian
Hadrian is an easy to use script to install Pantheon on Arch Linux. Or if you prefer, you can also follow a provided guide to install Pantheon without the script's automation so you can have the all the control.

### Why the Name?
A <b>Pantheon</b> is a building built in Rome in 27 BC. It was completely rebuilt by the <b>emperor Hadrian</b> sometime around AD 118 and 128. This script and emperor Hadrian has something in common so I went with the name (I tried to be creative).
