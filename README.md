# Hadrian
**Hadrian** is an easy to use script which installs Pantheon on Arch Linux.

Use this script at your **OWN RISK!** I made this script with *very little* bash scripting experience and with the help of a search engine and other helpful sources. I cannot guarantee it will not mess up your Arch Linux install and ***blow up your computer*** or say with confidence that Pantheon on Arch is stable enough for your needs.

## Information
**Pantheon** is a desktop environment developed by the same team that works on [elementary OS](https://elementary.io). It is elementary OS' dedicated desktop environment.

[**Arch Linux**](https://archlinux.org) is a Linux distribution that adheres to the KISS principle and is focused on simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility.

Choose a suitable working directory. I recommend an empty folder in your home directory with your name of choice.
