# Hadrian
**HADRIAN** is an easy to use bash script that installs Pantheon on Arch Linux.

Use this script at your **OWN RISK!** I made this script with *very little* scripting experience and with the help of a search engine and other helpful sources. I cannot confirm if it is stable enough for daily use or guarantee it will not start a ***thermonuclear war and eradicate all living beings***.

## Installation
If you prefer to install Pantheon manually, proceed to Manual Install.

First choose a suitable working directory. I recommend an empty folder in your home directory with your name of choice.
Now let's clone the Hadrian repository:

`git clone https://github.com/furesuka/Hadrian.git`

cd into the *Hadrian folder* and run **install.sh**:

`cd Hadrian/`


`sh install.sh`
